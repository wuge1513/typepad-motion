"""Settings for Motion sites.

Motion sites use and provide many settings for you to customize the Motion
site experience. Include the default values for these settings in your Django
project's settings by importing them at the top of your ``settings.py``
module::

    from motion.settings import *

You can then override the defaults later in your ``settings.py`` (or in an
imported ``local_settings.py``) as you would Django's default settings.
